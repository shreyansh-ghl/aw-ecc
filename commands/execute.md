# Execute

Use `/aw:execute` only as a compatibility entrypoint.
The canonical implementation stage is `/aw:build`.

## Role

Preserve legacy muscle memory while routing to the modern build contract.
Do not introduce a second implementation workflow.
This entrypoint inherits the same rule that build should finish the approved build scope or block explicitly before handing off.

## Routing Rule

- approved implementation work -> follow `/aw:build`
- bugfixes with unclear root cause -> prefer `/aw:investigate` first, then return to `/aw:build`
- old `/aw:tdd` expectations -> stay inside `/aw:build` and its RED-GREEN discipline

## Outputs

- implementation changes
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/execution.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/execution.html` when the routed `/aw:build` stage writes an HTML companion

## Human HTML Companion

`/aw:execute` inherits the `/aw:build` HTML companion contract.
Markdown remains canonical for agents, and `platform-core:echo-direct` produces the human review companion when output mode is `dual` or `html`.
Echo Direct is the default SDLC HTML path. Do not spawn `aw:echo` for this stage unless the user explicitly asks for a background/agent comparison; run `platform-core:echo-direct` in-process instead.
HTML sidecars are required before the final handoff. Load `platform-core:echo-direct`, let it invoke `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, and wait for the colocated `.html` sidecar. Do not freehand or command-template HTML outside that skill contract. Record successful Echo Direct execution as `status: generated`, `owner: platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, `execution_mode: skill`, `runner: platform-core:echo-direct`, and `echo_agent_status: in_process_fast_path`; do not record successful Echo Direct output as `generated_fallback` or `generated_hca_fallback`. Keep Markdown canonical and include Echo Direct/HCA provenance in the final handoff.

## Must Not Do

- must not drift into a separate execute-only workflow
- must not bypass the newer build, test, review, deploy, and ship stage definitions

## Recommended Next Commands

- `/aw:test`
- `/aw:review`

## Echo Direct/HCA Human Docs Handoff

After canonical Markdown and `state.json` are current, run `platform-core:echo-direct` for human docs generation and remote sharing unless the user explicitly requested local-only or Markdown-only docs. Pass the feature slug, source paths, profile, output mode, colocated HTML path, state path, and publish intent.

Do not duplicate docs publish commands or publish configuration in this stage. The Echo Direct/HCA handoff owns HTML generation and remote sharing. Before the final response, inspect the Echo Direct/HCA handoff result, feature `state.json`, and `.aw_docs/last-publish.json`. Add any returned or recorded `.html` links to the final `Remote Docs` section as visible absolute TeamOfOne URLs with compact clickable GitHub labels, not label-only text. Prefer `.html` companion links over `.md` links. A final handoff that lists only Markdown artifacts while `.html` remote links exist is incomplete. Each artifact must show `TeamOfOne: <absolute remote URL>` and `GitHub: [spec.html](<absolute repository URL>)` (or another short artifact label) when Echo Direct/HCA returns or records both; never collapse them to bare `TeamOfOne` and `GitHub` labels, hide the TeamOfOne URL behind Markdown-only links, or print long GitHub URLs inline when a compact label can point to the same URL. If Echo Direct/HCA cannot generate or publish, record `publish_status: blocked` and the concrete blocker in `state.json`; do not invent links.

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Compatibility Route`
- `Canonical Stage`
- `Changes`
- `Validation`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Remote Docs`
- `Next`
