# Test

Use `/aw:test` to prove the requested scope works with current evidence.

## Role

Run the smallest correct QA scope for the requested feature, fix, or release and write the evidence down clearly enough for review and deploy to trust it.

## Modes

| Mode | Use when | Primary outputs |
|---|---|---|
| `feature` | validating a scoped implementation | `verification.md`, `state.json` |
| `bugfix` | proving a repaired behavior and regression guard | `verification.md`, `state.json` |
| `release` | validating the broader release-ready scope | `verification.md`, `state.json` |
| `ui-runtime` | frontend runtime, responsive, and interaction proof | `verification.md`, `state.json` |

## Outputs

- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` when docs output mode is `dual` or `html`
- fresh evidence for local validation, E2E, external validation, or targeted runtime checks

## Human HTML Companion

Markdown `verification.md` remains canonical for agents.
When `/aw:test` writes or materially updates QA evidence, invoke `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` with the `verification-report` profile. Markdown-only is allowed only when the user explicitly requests it for this run.
Skill authorization: invoking `/aw:test` in `dual` or `html` output mode is an explicit user request to run `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` for the human-facing HTML companion. When the harness can spawn subagents, this also authorizes exactly one background `aw:echo` subagent, scoped only to HTML companion generation; do not spawn unrelated subagents.
HTML sidecars are required before the final handoff. Run `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` and wait for the colocated `.html` sidecar unless the user explicitly asks not to wait. Record the companion as `queued` or `generating` while an optional Echo subagent runs. If the tool layer cannot spawn `aw:echo`, continue in-process with the HCA skill; do not create stage-local fallback HTML. Record `status: generated`, `owner: platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, `execution_mode: skill`, and the Echo availability reason when HCA generates directly. If HCA itself cannot safely generate, record `status: blocked`, `publish_status: blocked`, and the exact blocker in `state.json`.

Record `html_companion_artifacts` in `state.json` with `source_path`, `html_path`, profile, status, `owner`, `execution_mode`, `run_ref` when available, publish status, any Echo availability reason, explicit Markdown-only skip, or blocked reason.

## QA Rules

1. Select the smallest correct test scope, not the loudest available suite.
2. Inherit the resolved GHL baseline profile for local validation, E2E, sandbox, and quality-gate expectations.
3. For bugfixes, prove the failing signal and the regression guard.
4. For frontend work, include responsive, accessibility-aware, and runtime evidence when relevant.
5. Continue until the requested QA scope is covered or explicitly blocked.
6. Mark unavailable checks as unavailable instead of inventing a pass.
7. Hand off to `/aw:review` when findings, governance, or readiness still need a decision.
8. Generate or explicitly record the HTML companion status before handoff.

## Must Not Do

- must not silently reuse stale evidence after code changed
- must not implement code while testing
- must not collapse feature QA and release readiness into one vague summary

## Recommended Next Commands

- `/aw:review`
- `/aw:build` if a failure requires repair

## HCA Human Docs Handoff

After canonical Markdown and `state.json` are current, invoke `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` for human docs generation and remote sharing unless the user explicitly requested local-only or Markdown-only docs. When the harness can spawn subagents, the skill may delegate to exactly one `aw:echo` companion job. Pass the feature slug, source paths, profile, output mode, colocated HTML path, state path, and publish intent.

Do not duplicate docs publish config or publisher internals in this stage. Add HCA/Echo returned links to the final `Remote Docs` section. If HCA/Echo cannot generate or publish, record `publish_status: blocked` and the concrete blocker in `state.json`; do not invent links.

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Mode`
- `Scope`
- `Checks Run`
- `Evidence`
- `Failures`
- `Unavailable`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Remote Docs`
- `Next`
