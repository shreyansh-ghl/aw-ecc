# Review

Use `/aw:review` to turn evidence into findings, readiness, and a clear next decision.

## Role

Review the work across correctness, simplicity, architecture, security, performance, governance, and release readiness.
This stage may request or rerun targeted tests when existing evidence is stale, missing, or too broad.

## Modes

| Mode | Use when | Primary outputs |
|---|---|---|
| `findings` | code and implementation review is the main goal | `verification.md`, `state.json` |
| `governance` | PR checklist, approvals, and status checks matter most | `verification.md`, `state.json` |
| `readiness` | a release recommendation is needed | `verification.md`, `state.json` |

## Outputs

- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` when docs output mode is `dual` or `html`
- explicit overall status: `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_NOTES`, or `FAIL`

## Human HTML Companion

Markdown `verification.md` remains canonical for agents.
When `/aw:review` writes or materially updates findings, governance, or readiness evidence, delegate to the `aw:echo` subagent with the `pr-one-pager` profile. Markdown-only is allowed only when the user explicitly requests it for this run.
Subagent authorization: invoking `/aw:review` in `dual` or `html` output mode is an explicit user request to delegate the human-facing HTML companion to exactly one background `aw:echo` subagent. This authorization is scoped only to HTML companion generation; do not spawn unrelated subagents.
HTML sidecars are required before the final handoff. Spawn exactly one `aw:echo` subagent and wait for the colocated `.html` sidecar unless the user explicitly asks not to wait. If the harness still cannot spawn `aw:echo`, or if the user asks for skill-only/direct Echo, load `platform-core:echo-direct` when available and otherwise load `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`; run direct HCA execution in the same turn. Do not freehand or command-template HTML outside that skill contract. Record successful direct HCA execution as `status: generated`, `owner: platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, `execution_mode: skill`, optional `runner: platform-core:echo-direct`, and `echo_agent_status: unavailable` with the exact Echo availability reason; when `platform-core:echo-direct` runs as the same-turn fast path, record `echo_agent_status: in_process_fast_path`; do not record successful HCA output as `generated_fallback` or `generated_hca_fallback`. Keep Markdown canonical and include HCA/Echo provenance in the final handoff.

Record `html_companion_artifacts` in `state.json` with `source_path`, `html_path`, profile, status, `owner`, `execution_mode`, `run_ref` when available, publish status, remote links, and any explicit Markdown-only skip, HCA/Echo provenance, or blocked reason.

## Review Rules

1. Review tests and validation evidence first.
2. Classify findings with explicit severity and evidence.
3. Load platform review, design, accessibility, and quality-gate playbooks when the baseline requires them.
4. Keep blocking findings separate from advisory notes.
5. Continue until the requested findings, governance, and readiness scope is covered or explicitly blocked.
6. Route back to `/aw:build` when repair is needed.
7. Do not clear findings on stale evidence.
8. Generate or explicitly record the HTML companion status before handoff.

## Must Not Do

- must not hide blocking findings inside summary prose
- must not implement code while reviewing
- must not treat reviewer agreement as evidence

## Recommended Next Commands

- `/aw:deploy`
- `/aw:build`

## HCA/Echo Human Docs Handoff

After canonical Markdown and `state.json` are current, delegate human docs generation and remote sharing to exactly one `aw:echo` companion job unless the user explicitly requested local-only, Markdown-only, or skill-only/direct Echo docs. For skill-only/direct Echo runs, use `platform-core:echo-direct` when available and otherwise run direct HCA in the same turn. Pass the feature slug, source paths, profile, output mode, colocated HTML path, state path, and publish intent.

Do not duplicate docs publish commands or publish configuration in this stage. The HCA/Echo handoff owns HTML generation and remote sharing. Before the final response, inspect the HCA/Echo handoff result, feature `state.json`, and `.aw_docs/last-publish.json`. Add any returned or recorded `.html` links to the final `Remote Docs` section as visible absolute TeamOfOne URLs with compact clickable GitHub labels, not label-only text. Prefer `.html` companion links over `.md` links. A final handoff that lists only Markdown artifacts while `.html` remote links exist is incomplete. Each artifact must show `TeamOfOne: <absolute remote URL>` and `GitHub: [spec.html](<absolute repository URL>)` (or another short artifact label) when HCA/Echo returns or records both; never collapse them to bare `TeamOfOne` and `GitHub` labels, hide the TeamOfOne URL behind Markdown-only links, or print long GitHub URLs inline when a compact label can point to the same URL. If HCA/Echo cannot generate or publish, record `publish_status: blocked` and the concrete blocker in `state.json`; do not invent links.

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Mode`
- `Evidence`
- `Findings`
- `Governance`
- `Readiness`
- `Outcome`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Remote Docs`
- `Next`
