# Verify

Use `/aw:verify` only as a compatibility entrypoint.
The canonical public model is now:

- `/aw:test` for QA and fresh evidence
- `/aw:review` for findings, governance, and readiness

## Role

Preserve legacy muscle memory while routing to the smallest correct modern verification flow.
This entrypoint inherits the same rule that the selected test or review scope should be completed or blocked explicitly before handoff.

## Compatibility Mapping

| Legacy intent | Canonical route |
|---|---|
| feature QA, regression proof, runtime validation | `/aw:test` |
| findings-oriented review, governance, readiness | `/aw:review` |
| broad "verify this" requests | `/aw:test -> /aw:review` when both are needed |

## Outputs

- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` and/or `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` when the routed stage writes an HTML companion

## Human HTML Companion

`/aw:verify` inherits the `/aw:test` and `/aw:review` HTML companion contracts.
Markdown remains canonical for agents, and `platform-core:echo-direct` produces the human review companion when output mode is `dual` or `html`.
Echo Direct is the default SDLC HTML path. Do not spawn `aw:echo` for this stage unless the user explicitly asks for a background/agent comparison; run `platform-core:echo-direct` in-process instead.
HTML sidecars are required before the final handoff. Load `platform-core:echo-direct`, let it invoke `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, and wait for the colocated `.html` sidecar. Do not freehand or command-template HTML outside that skill contract. Record successful Echo Direct execution as `status: generated`, `owner: platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, `execution_mode: skill`, `runner: platform-core:echo-direct`, and `echo_agent_status: in_process_fast_path`; do not record successful Echo Direct output as `generated_fallback` or `generated_hca_fallback`. Keep Markdown canonical and include Echo Direct/HCA provenance in the final handoff.

## Must Not Do

- must not preserve the old overloaded verify semantics when a narrower stage is clear
- must not bypass fresh evidence requirements

## Recommended Next Commands

- `/aw:test`
- `/aw:review`
- `/aw:deploy`

## Echo Direct/HCA Human Docs Handoff

After canonical Markdown and `state.json` are current, run `platform-core:echo-direct` for human docs generation and remote sharing unless the user explicitly requested local-only or Markdown-only docs. Pass the feature slug, source paths, profile, output mode, colocated HTML path, state path, and publish intent.

Do not duplicate docs publish commands or publish configuration in this stage. The Echo Direct/HCA handoff owns HTML generation and remote sharing. Before the final response, inspect the Echo Direct/HCA handoff result, feature `state.json`, and `.aw_docs/last-publish.json`. Add any returned or recorded `.html` links to the final `Remote Docs` section as visible absolute TeamOfOne URLs with compact clickable GitHub labels, not label-only text. Prefer `.html` companion links over `.md` links. A final handoff that lists only Markdown artifacts while `.html` remote links exist is incomplete. Each artifact must show `TeamOfOne: <absolute remote URL>` and `GitHub: [spec.html](<absolute repository URL>)` (or another short artifact label) when Echo Direct/HCA returns or records both; never collapse them to bare `TeamOfOne` and `GitHub` labels, hide the TeamOfOne URL behind Markdown-only links, or print long GitHub URLs inline when a compact label can point to the same URL. If Echo Direct/HCA cannot generate or publish, record `publish_status: blocked` and the concrete blocker in `state.json`; do not invent links.

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Compatibility Route`
- `Canonical Flow`
- `Evidence`
- `Outcome`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Remote Docs`
- `Next`
