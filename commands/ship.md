# Ship

Use `/aw:ship` for launch discipline, not as the old composite "do everything" shortcut.

## Role

Confirm the release is ready to launch, roll it out safely, document rollback readiness, and close out the release with the right operational evidence.

## Modes

| Mode | Use when | Primary outputs |
|---|---|---|
| `launch-readiness` | a go/no-go launch decision is needed | `release.md`, `state.json` |
| `rollout` | staged or production rollout needs monitoring and checkpoints | `release.md`, `state.json` |
| `closeout` | the release action happened and needs operational closeout | `release.md`, `state.json` |

## Required Inputs

- reviewed work
- deploy outcome or explicit release target
- rollback plan or blocker
- monitoring or health-check context when available

## Outputs

- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/release.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/release.html` when docs output mode is `dual` or `html`
- launch recommendation, rollout checkpoints, rollback path, and closeout notes

## Human HTML Companion

Markdown `release.md` remains canonical for agents.
When `/aw:ship` writes or materially updates launch, rollout, rollback, or closeout evidence, run `platform-core:echo-direct` with the `release-report` profile. Markdown-only is allowed only when the user explicitly requests it for this run.
Echo Direct is the default SDLC HTML path. Do not spawn `aw:echo` for this stage unless the user explicitly asks for a background/agent comparison; run `platform-core:echo-direct` in-process instead.
HTML sidecars are required before the final handoff. Load `platform-core:echo-direct`, let it invoke `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, and wait for the colocated `.html` sidecar. Do not freehand or command-template HTML outside that skill contract. Record successful Echo Direct execution as `status: generated`, `owner: platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, `execution_mode: skill`, `runner: platform-core:echo-direct`, and `echo_agent_status: in_process_fast_path`; do not record successful Echo Direct output as `generated_fallback` or `generated_hca_fallback`. Keep Markdown canonical and include Echo Direct/HCA provenance in the final handoff.

Record `html_companion_artifacts` in `state.json` with `source_path`, `html_path`, profile, status, `owner`, `execution_mode`, `runner`, `echo_agent_status`, publish status, remote links, and any explicit Markdown-only skip, Echo Direct/HCA provenance, or blocked reason.

## Shipping Rules

1. Treat rollout safety as its own stage.
2. Run the internal `aw-prepare` gate when release context, workspace state, or artifact readiness is unclear before continuing with shipping work.
3. Continue until the selected shipping scope is covered or explicitly blocked.
4. Confirm rollback readiness before claiming launch readiness.
5. Capture post-deploy evidence, monitoring links, and known risks.
6. For frontend releases, include versioned entry, smoke, and accessibility or design-signoff notes when relevant.
7. Do not use `ship` as a synonym for composite orchestration.
8. Generate or explicitly record the HTML companion status before handoff.

## Internal Phase Routing

| Phase | Internal owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `prepare` | `aw-prepare` | verify release context, artifact readiness, and workspace safety before risky shipping work |
| `ship` | `aw-ship` | own launch readiness, rollout safety, rollback posture, and closeout evidence |

## Must Not Do

- must not quietly rerun the whole SDLC under the name `ship`
- must not claim launch safety without rollback or monitoring context
- must not bypass org-specific release gates

## Recommended Next Commands

- none required
- `/aw:review` if new launch blockers appear

## Echo Direct/HCA Human Docs Handoff

After canonical Markdown and `state.json` are current, run `platform-core:echo-direct` for human docs generation and remote sharing unless the user explicitly requested local-only or Markdown-only docs. Pass the feature slug, source paths, profile, output mode, colocated HTML path, state path, and publish intent.

Do not duplicate docs publish commands or publish configuration in this stage. The Echo Direct/HCA handoff owns HTML generation and remote sharing. Before the final response, inspect the Echo Direct/HCA handoff result, feature `state.json`, and `.aw_docs/last-publish.json`. Add any returned or recorded `.html` links to the final `Remote Docs` section as visible absolute TeamOfOne URLs with compact clickable GitHub labels, not label-only text. Prefer `.html` companion links over `.md` links. A final handoff that lists only Markdown artifacts while `.html` remote links exist is incomplete. Each artifact must show `TeamOfOne: <absolute remote URL>` and `GitHub: [spec.html](<absolute repository URL>)` (or another short artifact label) when Echo Direct/HCA returns or records both; never collapse them to bare `TeamOfOne` and `GitHub` labels, hide the TeamOfOne URL behind Markdown-only links, or print long GitHub URLs inline when a compact label can point to the same URL. If Echo Direct/HCA cannot generate or publish, record `publish_status: blocked` and the concrete blocker in `state.json`; do not invent links.

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Mode`
- `Launch Readiness`
- `Rollout Plan`
- `Rollback Path`
- `Evidence`
- `Outcome`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Remote Docs`
- `Next`
