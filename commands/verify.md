# Verify

Use `/aw:verify` only as a compatibility entrypoint.
The canonical public model is now:

- `/aw:test` for QA and fresh evidence
- `/aw:review` for findings, governance, and readiness

## Role

Preserve legacy muscle memory while routing to the smallest correct modern verification flow.
This entrypoint inherits the same rule that the selected test or review scope should be completed or blocked explicitly before handoff.

## Compatibility Mapping

| Legacy intent | Canonical route |
|---|---|
| feature QA, regression proof, runtime validation | `/aw:test` |
| findings-oriented review, governance, readiness | `/aw:review` |
| broad "verify this" requests | `/aw:test -> /aw:review` when both are needed |

## Outputs

- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` and/or `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` when the routed stage writes an HTML companion

## Human HTML Companion

Markdown `verification.md` remains canonical for agents.
When `/aw:verify` routes to `/aw:test`, `/aw:review`, or both and writes or materially updates verification evidence, HTML sidecars are required in `dual` and `html` output modes. Use `platform-core:echo-direct` directly to generate or refresh `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` with the `verification-report` or `pr-one-pager` profile based on the routed stage.

Resolve docs output mode in this order: explicit user or session request, stage-local request, `.aw_docs/config.json` `docs.outputMode`, `AW_DOCS_OUTPUT_MODE`, then default `dual`.
- `dual` mode keeps Markdown canonical and requires the HTML companion.
- `html` mode requires the HTML companion and still preserves any canonical Markdown the stage must write.
- explicit Markdown-only mode skips HTML and records `status: skipped` with `skip_reason: explicit_markdown_only`.

Do not use a subagent for HTML generation, and do not hand-roll or command-template HTML outside `platform-core:echo-direct`. In `dual` or `html` mode, the stage is not complete until the skill has generated the sidecar or recorded a concrete blocker. In explicit Markdown-only mode, do not generate HTML.

Record `html_companion_artifacts` in `state.json` with `source_path`, `html_path`, profile, `status: generated` when successful, `owner: platform-core:echo-direct`, `execution_mode: skill`, `runner: platform-core:echo-direct`, publish status, remote links, and any explicit Markdown-only skip or blocked reason. Do not record successful skill output as `generated_fallback` or `generated_hca_fallback`; those are legacy statuses to repair.

## Must Not Do

- must not preserve the old overloaded verify semantics when a narrower stage is clear
- must not bypass fresh evidence requirements

## Recommended Next Commands

- `/aw:test`
- `/aw:review`
- `/aw:deploy`

## Echo Direct Human Docs Handoff

After canonical Markdown and `state.json` are current, run `platform-core:echo-direct` for every required human companion in `dual` or `html` mode. Pass the feature slug, source paths, profile, output mode, colocated HTML path, state path, and publish intent. This same skill is also the repair path for existing folders with missing, stale, blocked, local-only, legacy uncontrolled fallback, unpublished, or linkless companions.

Do not duplicate docs publish commands or publish configuration in this stage. `platform-core:echo-direct` owns HTML generation, publish handoff, companion state updates, and returned TeamOfOne/GitHub links. Before the final response, inspect the skill result, feature `state.json`, and `.aw_docs/last-publish.json`. Add any returned or recorded `.html` links to the final `Remote Docs` section as plain-text absolute TeamOfOne URLs (no Markdown link syntax around the TeamOfOne URL) with compact clickable GitHub labels, not label-only text. Prefer `.html` companion links over `.md` links. A final handoff that lists only Markdown artifacts while `.html` remote links exist is incomplete. Each artifact must show `TeamOfOne: <absolute remote URL>` as raw visible text and `GitHub: [spec.html](<absolute repository URL>)` or another short artifact label when both URLs are available. Never render TeamOfOne as `[TeamOfOne](...)`, `[Spec TeamOfOne](...)`, or any other Markdown link label; never hide the TeamOfOne URL behind Markdown-only links, never print long GitHub URLs inline when a compact label can point to the same URL, and never invent links. If publishing cannot run, record `publish_status: blocked` and the concrete blocker in `state.json`.

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Compatibility Route`
- `Canonical Flow`
- `Evidence`
- `Outcome`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Remote Docs`
- `Next`
