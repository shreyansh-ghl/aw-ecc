# Execute

Use `/aw:execute` only as a compatibility entrypoint.
The canonical implementation stage is `/aw:build`.

## Role

Preserve legacy muscle memory while routing to the modern build contract.
Do not introduce a second implementation workflow.
This entrypoint inherits the same rule that build should finish the approved build scope or block explicitly before handing off.

## Routing Rule

- approved implementation work -> follow `/aw:build`
- bugfixes with unclear root cause -> prefer `/aw:investigate` first, then return to `/aw:build`
- old `/aw:tdd` expectations -> stay inside `/aw:build` and its RED-GREEN discipline

## Outputs

- implementation changes
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/execution.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/execution.html` when the routed `/aw:build` stage writes an HTML companion

## Human HTML Companion

`/aw:execute` inherits the `/aw:build` HTML companion contract.
Markdown remains canonical for agents, and `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` produces the human review companion when output mode is `dual` or `html`.
Skill authorization: invoking `/aw:execute` in `dual` or `html` output mode is an explicit user request to run `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` for the human-facing HTML companion. When the harness can spawn subagents, this also authorizes exactly one background `aw:echo` subagent, scoped only to HTML companion generation; do not spawn unrelated subagents.
HTML sidecars are required before the final handoff. Run `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` and wait for the colocated `.html` sidecar unless the user explicitly asks not to wait. Record the companion as `queued` or `generating` while an optional Echo subagent runs. If the tool layer cannot spawn `aw:echo`, continue in-process with the HCA skill; do not create stage-local fallback HTML. Record `status: generated`, `owner: platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts`, `execution_mode: skill`, and the Echo availability reason when HCA generates directly. If HCA itself cannot safely generate, record `status: blocked`, `publish_status: blocked`, and the exact blocker in `state.json`.

## Must Not Do

- must not drift into a separate execute-only workflow
- must not bypass the newer build, test, review, deploy, and ship stage definitions

## Recommended Next Commands

- `/aw:test`
- `/aw:review`

## HCA Human Docs Handoff

After canonical Markdown and `state.json` are current, invoke `platform-core:human-collaboration-artifacts` for human docs generation and remote sharing unless the user explicitly requested local-only or Markdown-only docs. When the harness can spawn subagents, the skill may delegate to exactly one `aw:echo` companion job. Pass the feature slug, source paths, profile, output mode, colocated HTML path, state path, and publish intent.

Do not duplicate docs publish config or publisher internals in this stage. Add HCA/Echo returned links to the final `Remote Docs` section. If HCA/Echo cannot generate or publish, record `publish_status: blocked` and the concrete blocker in `state.json`; do not invent links.

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Compatibility Route`
- `Canonical Stage`
- `Changes`
- `Validation`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Remote Docs`
- `Next`
