# Verify

Use `/aw:verify` only as a compatibility entrypoint.
The canonical public model is now:

- `/aw:test` for QA and fresh evidence
- `/aw:review` for findings, governance, and readiness

## Role

Preserve legacy muscle memory while routing to the smallest correct modern verification flow.
This entrypoint inherits the same rule that the selected test or review scope should be completed or blocked explicitly before handoff.

## Compatibility Mapping

| Legacy intent | Canonical route |
|---|---|
| feature QA, regression proof, runtime validation | `/aw:test` |
| findings-oriented review, governance, readiness | `/aw:review` |
| broad "verify this" requests | `/aw:test -> /aw:review` when both are needed |

## Outputs

- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.md`
- updated `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/state.json`
- `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` and/or `.aw_docs/features/<feature_slug>/verification.html` when the routed stage writes an HTML companion

## Human HTML Companion

`/aw:verify` inherits the `/aw:test` and `/aw:review` HTML companion contracts.
Markdown remains canonical for agents, and the `aw:echo` subagent produces the human review companion when output mode is `dual` or `html`.
Subagent authorization: invoking `/aw:verify` in `dual` or `html` output mode is an explicit user request to delegate the human-facing HTML companion to exactly one background `aw:echo` subagent. This authorization is scoped only to HTML companion generation; do not spawn unrelated subagents.
HTML sidecars are required before the final handoff. Spawn exactly one `aw:echo` subagent and wait for the colocated `.html` sidecar unless the user explicitly asks not to wait. If the harness still cannot spawn `aw:echo`, create a conservative self-contained fallback HTML sidecar in the same turn, record `generated_fallback` with the blocker, and keep Markdown canonical.

## Must Not Do

- must not preserve the old overloaded verify semantics when a narrower stage is clear
- must not bypass fresh evidence requirements

## Recommended Next Commands

- `/aw:test`
- `/aw:review`
- `/aw:deploy`

## Final Output Shape

Always end with:

- `Compatibility Route`
- `Canonical Flow`
- `Evidence`
- `Outcome`
- `HTML Companion`
- `Next`
