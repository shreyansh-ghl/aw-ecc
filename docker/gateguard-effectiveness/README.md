# GateGuard question effectiveness

Development-only harness that runs real Claude sessions on trapped coding
tasks with and without GateGuard's questions. Design, arms, measures and
results: [docs/gateguard/question-effectiveness.md](../../docs/gateguard/question-effectiveness.md).

Two runners, measuring different things.

`run.js` — cost baseline. One-shot autonomous sessions over `scenarios/`, where
each trap hides its deciding fact in the repository. The pilot returned no
outcome difference between any arm, so treat this as a measure of the gate's
turn and token cost, not of its effect.

```bash
node docker/gateguard-effectiveness/run.js --out gg-eff --dry-run
node docker/gateguard-effectiveness/run.js --out gg-eff --model <model> --allow-real-provider
```

`run-intent.js` — effectiveness. Multi-turn sessions over `scenarios-intent/`,
where the deciding fact exists only in a simulated user's hidden intent, so an
agent that does not ask can only guess. Scenario files omit declared gate
question targets, but this does not establish blind or independent authorship:
the authors knew the taxonomy, and the external-contract question was added
after inspecting this corpus. Treat those results as exploratory. The report
classifies behavior into descriptive hole categories.

Each run writes `meta.json`, raw `results.jsonl`, transcripts, `summary.json`,
`holes.md`, and `evidence.json`. The evidence manifest fingerprints the frozen
scenario and harness inputs and hashes the output artifacts. Verify an output
directory with `--verify`; this detects later file changes but is not a
cryptographic signature or proof of who ran the experiment.

```bash
node docker/gateguard-effectiveness/run-intent.js --check-graders
node docker/gateguard-effectiveness/run-intent.js --out gg-intent --arms off,gate --dry-run
node docker/gateguard-effectiveness/run-intent.js --out gg-intent --model <model> --allow-real-provider
node docker/gateguard-effectiveness/run-intent.js --out gg-intent --summarize
node docker/gateguard-effectiveness/run-intent.js --out gg-intent --verify
```

Runs sharing an output directory are serialized by `.run.lock`; concurrent workers
must use separate `--out` directories. Normal completion and errors release the
lock. After a killed process, confirm that its worker has stopped before removing
the stale lock and resuming. Metadata uses private exclusive temporary creation
and atomic rename so a destination symlink cannot redirect metadata writes.
